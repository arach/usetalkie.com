## The keyboard is a bottleneck

We've spent fifty years optimizing for fingers on keys. Every productivity tool, every shortcut, every macro — all designed around the assumption that you're sitting at a desk, hands on a keyboard, eyes on a screen.

But your best thinking doesn't happen at your desk.

It happens on walks. In the shower. Between meetings. While cooking dinner. The moments when your mind is free to wander are precisely the moments when it produces its best work. And in those moments, you have no keyboard.

## Speech is the original interface

Long before we learned to type, we learned to speak. Language is the most natural, most expressive, most *human* way to communicate ideas. We can speak roughly 150 words per minute — three times faster than most people type. And speaking requires no special posture, no dedicated device, no learning curve.

Yet somehow, we've built an entire computing paradigm that ignores this.

## The gap between thought and capture

Every idea that goes uncaptured is an idea that's lost. Not because you forgot it entirely — you might remember the *shape* of it later — but because you lost the nuance. The specific phrasing. The connections your mind was making in that moment.

The gap between having a thought and being able to record it is where ideas go to die. And that gap is defined by the tools we use.

Pull out your phone. Open an app. Find the right note. Start typing with your thumbs. By the time you've done all that, the thought has already started to fade. The rich, branching, interconnected idea has been compressed into a few hurried words.

## Voice closes the gap

Voice capture is fundamentally different. You speak at the speed of thought. There's no context switch, no app to find, no keyboard to orient yourself on. You just... talk.

And when the transcription happens locally — on your device, in real time — there's no latency. No waiting for a server. No privacy trade-off. Just your words, captured instantly, exactly as you said them.

This is what we mean by *voice-first*. Not voice-only. Not voice-instead-of-everything-else. Voice as the **entry point** — the fastest path from thought to captured text. What happens after that — editing, organizing, transforming — can use whatever interface makes sense. But the capture moment should be frictionless.

## From capture to action

Capturing words is only the first step. The real power comes from what happens next.

Raw transcription is messy. It has filler words, false starts, tangents. But it also contains the real substance of your thinking. The challenge is extracting signal from noise — and doing it in a way that respects the original intent.

This is where local AI becomes essential. Not cloud AI that uploads your thoughts to someone else's servers. Local models that run on your device, that understand context, that can transform a rambling voice memo into a structured note, a task list, a draft email.

The pipeline looks like this:

1. **Capture** — speak freely, anywhere
2. **Transcribe** — on-device, in real time
3. **Transform** — local AI extracts structure and meaning
4. **Route** — results go where they belong (notes, tasks, calendar, code)

Each step happens on your hardware. Each step respects your privacy. And each step brings you closer to a world where the distance between having an idea and acting on it approaches zero.

## The principles

We think voice-first computing should follow a few core principles:

**Local by default.** Your voice is intimate. It shouldn't leave your device unless you explicitly choose to send it somewhere. On-device transcription and on-device AI aren't just nice-to-haves — they're requirements.

**Speed over perfection.** A 95% accurate transcript captured in the moment is infinitely more valuable than a 100% accurate one you never made because the friction was too high.

**Capture now, organize later.** Don't make people categorize things in the moment of inspiration. Let them dump thoughts quickly and sort them out later, when they're at their desk.

**Your tools, your data.** Voice-first doesn't mean voice-only. It means voice is the *on-ramp*. The off-ramp should be whatever tools you already use — your text editor, your task manager, your email client.

## What we're building

Talkie is our attempt to make voice-first computing real. Not as a gimmick or a novelty, but as a genuine workflow — one that's faster, more natural, and more private than what exists today.

We're building for people who think faster than they type. For people whose best ideas come at inconvenient times. For people who want their tools to work *with* their brain, not against it.

The keyboard isn't going anywhere. But it shouldn't be the only way in.
